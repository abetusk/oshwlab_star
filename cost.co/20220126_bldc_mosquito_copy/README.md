Description
---

Fully integrated G031 with DRV8313, size 20mm x 20mm, capable of running SimpleFOC. Contains a proper step-down buck converter and an angle sensor on the back connected to SPI2 on that chip. End result is a 20x20mm, 2A max, 8 to 24V SimpleFOC BLDC driver with an integrated SPI / 20k RPM angle sensor on the back.
